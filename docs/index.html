        Why Functional CSS?
      </h3>
      <p class="measure-wide">
        So many reasons, but the simplest answer is that we believe it's a better choice to handle the complexity of CSS in the Template, rather than the CSS level.
      </p>
      <p class="measure-wide">
        Even the best of CSS authors can suffer the Fragile Base Class Problem, and that is amplified across teams of differing skill level.
      </p>
      <h3 class="i">
        Why don't you use a CSS-in-JS solution?
      </h3>
      <p class="measure-wide">
        Not every project is a Javascript Single Page Application, and I am not convinced that it's a smart idea to require a build pipeline for every prototype, idea or product. Sharing the css utilities across projects and ideas promotes adoption of a component
        library.

        Benefits
      </h3>
      <p class="measure-wide">
        Most UI libraries require you to include their CSS anyway, with the downside of adding that bloat for just their components. Using a functional CSS library allows you to power the Mandala components, as well as your own components with the same syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        If something doesn't exist in the Mandala Library currently, compose it and submit it!
